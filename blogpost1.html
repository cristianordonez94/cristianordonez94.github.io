        <div class="image image4 mb-5 pb-5"></div>
        <div class="mt-5 pt-35"><p>When I first began exercising at my local gym, I remember walking to the front desk and seeing stacks of different powders and pill bottles. Since I was new to the nutrition world at the time I had no idea what any of these supplements were used for and instantly felt overwhelmed. It became even worse when I went to the GNC next door, which was filled with endless shelves of supplements filled with ingredients that sounded they were made in a laboratory somewhere. If this sounds like something you also experienced, then read on because I am going to talk about supplements, such as what they are and if they are effective, to help anyone who finds themselves in the shoes I was once in. Keep in mind though that before taking any supplement, make sure that you meet with a Registered Dietitian face to face to see if they are right for you.  </p>
        <h5>What is a supplement?</h5>
        <p>There are currently thousands of different supplements on the market and your 
            idea of what a supplement is may be different than what your government defines it as. These items can be 
          in several different forms such as pills, powders, drinks, or bars. They can claim to help you with weight loss, 
          weight gain, workout recovery, or even preventing illness. 
            In the United States supplements are regulated by the Office of Dietary Supplement programs 
          within the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They define a supplement as any product that contains any of 
          the following<sup>1</sup>: vitamin, mineral, herb or other botanical, amino acid, or any mix of these
          ingredients. 
            </p>
            <h5>Do I need a supplement?</h5>
            <p>While some supplements can certainly help you achieve some of your fitness goals, it is important to take 
              a step back and really ask yourself if it is worth taking for you. Just because you see someone on Instagram 
              taking a certain supplement doesn’t mean it will be right for your body or your goals. In fact, it might not 
              even benefit them as many 
              supplement companies pay these people for exposure as a walking advertisement. So, you should ask yourself
              four important questions before you make any decision: Is the supplement safe to take? Is it legal for me to 
              take? Is it effective? Can I afford it?</p>
            <h5>Is it safe?</h5>
            <p>Taking too much of any supplement can have serious negative side effects, and one should always consult with
              a registered dietitian before beginning any new supplement. While caffeine can be safe if taken in small amounts
              (such as in a cup of coffee) many nutrition supplements can have very high amounts of caffeine that can have
              negative side effects<sup>2</sup> such as trouble sleeping, anxiety, or even heart problems. There are other products
              that are never safe to take in even small amounts, such as the once popular supplements Hydroxycut and OxyElite 
              Pro<sup>3</sup>. Studies have found that taking these supplements led to liver problems in many people.
              Another ingredient that was found to be harmful is called DMAA or Dimeethylexanamine<sup>4</sup>. These were 
              found in a number of supplements in the United States and the FDA stated that they could lead to high blood 
              pressure or heart attacks. Even though they are banned for sale by the FDA, there have been reports of several
              supplements that were still found to contain this ingredient even though it was not listed on the 
              ingredients label<sup>5</sup>. This highlights the importance of consulting with a registered dietitian as they 
              would be able to provide you with an up to date list of supplements that have been found 
              to be safe to consume and not banned by any federations. This also leads us to our next question to ask ourselves about supplements, 
              which is:</p>
            <h5>Is it legal?</h5>
            <p>The FDA has a list of banned substances that they say can have negative side effects or have ingredients that can potentialy be dangerous. Many sport federations also have their own list that they provide
              their athletes. But like I mentioned above, even if the item doesn’t seem to have anything that is banned, it
              might contain something that they have not listed in their ingredients. For example, one study looked at 634 
              supplements and tested them all to see if they contained any illegal or banned ingredients<sup>5</sup>. What 
              they found was astonishing: about 94 of these 634 supplements (15%) had ingredients that they stated were 
              “steroid-like” and on the list of banned substances. So while it is always important to read the ingredients
              label of anything you might take, you should also realize that supplement companies are not always honest with 
              their customers. </p>
            <h5>Is it effective?</h5>
            <p>Now to point that many of you were probably waiting for: will it actually work? Good question and probably not
              as straightforward as you might think. While yes, there are a few supplements that have been shown to improve 
              certain parts of athletic performance (which, don’t worry, we will get to) none of these can replace a good
              meal plan and a diet rich with nutrients. Because at the end of the day these are all diet supplements and NOT 
              diet replacements. Therefore, all of these items should be treated as such (so tune in to my next blog post
              where I’ll talk about meal planning for athletes). With that being said, if you do have an amazing meal plan 
              set up but want to see what might bring that extra oomph, then read on. The most effective supplements 
              according to researchers are, in no particular order, are creatine<sup>6</sup>, whey protein<sup>7</sup>, and
              beta-alanine<sup>8</sup>. </p>
            <p> Whey protein is probably the most well-known on this list and can be found at most supermarkets or health
              food stores. It is most useful when someone can’t seem to get enough protein in their diet from whole foods. 
              Most importantly, they have been shown to be safe to use in a number of research studies<sup>7</sup>.  
                 
                </p>
            <p>Creatine is a substance found in our muscles that may be able to help with recovery, injury prevention, and 
              rehabilitation for athletes<sup>6</sup>. It has also been shown to cause little to no side effects in people taking this
              supplement.</p>
            <p>Finally, we have beta-alanine, which an amino acid that may help with increased total body 
              strength<sup>8</sup>.  However, all the participants in this study were already healthy to begin with, so these
              results should be taken with a pretty big grain of salt (as should most studies to be honest).</p>
            <h5>Can I afford it?</h5>
            <p>For some people this question might not be as important as others, while for others (myself included)
              it is probably one of the first things you ask yourself. Because even if you do find a perfect supplement 
              that answers all the other three questions (it is safe, legal and effective) if you can’t afford it then it 
              won’t really matter. So when looking at supplements, make sure you are checking the price per serving 
              beforehand and do not be afraid to ask your dietitian for any brands that might save you some money. Also,
              if money is an issue, make sure you don’t forego whole foods to buy supplements instead. People sometimes 
              mistakenly think that supplements can give them the greatest bang for their buck, but they do not realize 
              that there are much better whole food alternatives for a fraction of the price. In the future I will write 
              a post highlighting how to grocery shop on a budget, so make sure to be tuned for that if this point really
              hits home with you. </p>
            <h5>In conclusion...</h5>
            <p>The main take away from this mountain of information should be that nothing can really beat a well-designed 
              meal plan created by a Registered Dietitian. So before looking into making any supplement purchases, you should 
              consult with a dietitian and have them help you create a meal plan suited to your needs. By doing this they 
              will be able to design an individualized meal plan that matches the foods you enjoy, avoids the foods you do 
              not, and also is tailored into your schedule and exercise routine. This is important because not any one meal
              plan is perfect for all people, just like not any supplement is right for everyone. And if you do get the go 
              ahead to make a supplement purchase, make sure to discuss these four questions with your dietitian: Is it safe?
              Is it legal? Is it Effective? Can I afford it?</p>
